It may happen that the Cooling Units are not correctly regulated to a higher fan speed which could result in critical temperature situations where AMCs are not sufficiently cooled.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Engineering has deleted firmware version 2.17.9 from the archive and strongly recommends not to use any copies in any of your systems. You can either switch back to an older version 2.17.8 or to the new version 2.17.10 which is released today. MCH firmware version 2.17.10 fixed said problem.\r\n','2016-04-18 08:46:31',3,NULL,NULL,NULL),
